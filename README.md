This is my project that got into the final phase of the Intel AI4Youth 2022 competition and was essentially my gateway to the world of AI!

## The Background
The AI project, developed for the Intel AI4Youth competition in 2022, focused on addressing a specific problem using deep learning techniques. It's the effort of our 3 people group of classmates. Our objective was to improve accuracy in a particular domain and contribute to solving a real-world challenge.

In terms of data, we carefully curated a comprehensive dataset that was relevant to our problem. We devoted considerable effort to data acquisition and preprocessing, ensuring high quality and consistency. This allowed us to train our AI model on a diverse range of examples, facilitating robust and accurate predictions. The results of our project were remarkable. Through iterative experimentation and refinement, we achieved the accuracy of 99%

The success of our project can be attributed to our collaborative efforts as a team. With effective communication and coordination, each team member contributed their unique expertise. As the group leader, I assigned specific roles and responsibilities, allowing us to make efficient progress while leveraging each other's strengths. Overcoming challenges together, we built not only an advanced AI model but also developed invaluable communication and teamwork skills.

## How to run it?
1. Download the repo
2. Select Python interpreter
3. Use the included virtual environment folder or download all the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install nltk
pip install scikit-learn
```
4. Run the program
5. Be patient. It might take some time to run it since the dataset is big. After the running process is complete, you will get the results in terminal.
